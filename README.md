# 🧰 Fixing the “Permission Denied” Issue on EVE-NG

If you’ve suffered enough like I did with **EVE-NG** throwing a *Permission Denied* error when trying to fix permissions, no worries, you’re in the right place! 😅

```bash
/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions


```
and get

```bash
bash: /opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper: Permission denied
